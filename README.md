# My Build of DWM, the dynamic window manager

This is my build of the DWM tiling manager, from suckless.org.

It is a dynamic tiling manager built to be minimalist and fast (which it is). All configuration is done by editing the source code directly, which is often done by applying 'patches' that others have written. 

See the website for a download and more info. 

## My Build

I've added a few patches from the website, including:

- Scratchpad (enabling a pull down terminal)
- Vanity gaps (gaps between windows for... vanity)
- Fibonacci and Centered Master (for different tile layouts)
- Swallow (so things like pdfs opened from terminal swallow those terminals)
- Restart (restart keybound to avoid log out log in when making changes) 

I also configured a few things such as basic shortcuts. My status bar is set elsewhere with a bash script and xsetroot (see my dotfiles). 

Feel free to take anything you find useful.
